Shiny App to detect the QRS complex.

## Introduction

This Shiny App implements the algorithm proposed by Pan and Tompkins to detect QRS complexes, and the algorithm proposed by Mohamed Elgendi, Bjoern Eskofier, and Derek Abbott for the detection of P and T waves in electrocardiogram samples through the R programming language.

## Methodology

This app uses 20 electrocardiogram signaling samples randomly downloaded from the [ECG-ID Database (ecgiddb)](https://physionet.org/content/ecgiddb/1.0.0/) available on the Physionet platform, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
